# Power-Tools-Sharing-Client-iOS

Contains the iOS source code for Power Tools Sharing application.

### Background

Every building, every neighborhood, has people passionate about owning every power tool imaginable. 
These are expensive and almost never used. They should be shared.

### Challenge

Part of the reason why nobody is winning in this space is because the for-profit nature of these, 
bound to needing to lend these ites for money. Instead, build a non-for-profit sharing economy where 
individuals are just sharing without asking anything in return, around power tools, an app, site, etc.

### Current Status

Currently the client application is only supported on iOS devices. The mobile application currently allows user
to do following things:
* View public tools (No need of registration or login)
* Upload New Tools (registration or login required)
* Register New Account
* Login to Existing Account

Mobile application calls the RESTful APIs exposed by server for all remote communication.

### Whats Next

Next development interation will include below items:
* Support for marking a power tool "Unavailable" or "Available"
* Support for deleting user uploaded tool

### Technologies Used

* Objective-c - Development language for developing iOS application
* XCode 7.1 - IDE for iOS application development
* iOS Simulator - Application used for quickly testing iOS application before running on actual device
* iPhone 5S - Used as base device for developer level testing before releasing to others
