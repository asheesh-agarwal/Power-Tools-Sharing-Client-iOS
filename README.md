# Power-Tools-Sharing-Client-iOS

Contains the iOS source code for Power Tools Sharing application.

### Background

Every building, every neighborhood, has people passionate about owning every power tool imaginable. 
These are expensive and almost never used. They should be shared.

### Challenge

Part of the reason why nobody is winning in this space is because the for-profit nature of these, 
bound to needing to lend these ites for money. Instead, build a non-for-profit sharing economy where 
individuals are just sharing without asking anything in return, around power tools, an app, site, etc.

### Current Status

Currently the client application is only supported on iOS devices. The mobile application currently allows user
to register his account and login to their account so that they can upload their power tools for sharing. 

Mobile application calls the RESTful APIs exposed by server for all remote communication.

### Whats Next

Next development interation will include below items:
* Support for adding and uploading a power tool from mobile application.
* Support for marking a power tool loaned.

### Technologies Used

* Objective-c - Development language for developing iOS application
* XCode 7.0.1 - IDE for iOS application development
* iOS Simulator - Application used for quickly testing iOS application before running on actual device
